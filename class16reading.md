# The key characteristics of serverless computing
Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where developers can build and run applications without having to manage the underlying server infrastructure. Some key characteristics of serverless computing include:

Abstraction of Servers: Serverless platforms abstract away the server management tasks, such as provisioning, scaling, and maintenance. Developers can focus solely on writing and deploying code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Event-Driven Execution: Serverless functions are triggered by specific events or requests, such as HTTP requests, database updates, or file uploads. They are executed in a stateless manner, responding to events in near real-time.

Automatic Scaling: Serverless platforms automatically scale the execution environment based on the incoming workload. Functions are scaled up or down to match the demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization and responsiveness.

Pay-per-Use Pricing: Serverless platforms typically charge based on the actual usage of resources, such as the number of function invocations and the execution time. This allows for cost optimization, as users only pay for the resources consumed during the function's execution.

Stateless Execution: Serverless functions are stateless, meaning they don't maintain any persistent state between invocations. Any required state is typically stored externally, such as in a database or object storage service.

Compared to traditional server-based architectures, serverless computing differs in the following ways:

Infrastructure Management: In traditional server-based architectures, developers are responsible for provisioning, configuring, and managing the servers. In serverless computing, infrastructure management is abstracted away, and developers can focus on writing code without worrying about server administration.

Scalability: Traditional architectures often require manual scaling of servers to handle increased traffic or workload. In serverless computing, scaling is automatic and handled by the platform based on the demand, allowing for seamless scalability without the need for manual intervention.

Cost Model: Traditional architectures involve upfront costs for server provisioning and ongoing costs for server maintenance, regardless of the actual usage. In serverless computing, users only pay for the resources consumed during function execution, leading to more cost-efficient resource utilization.

Operational Overhead: Traditional architectures require continuous monitoring, patching, and maintenance of the servers. With serverless computing, much of the operational overhead is shifted to the cloud provider, reducing the burden on developers and allowing them to focus more on application development.

Overall, serverless computing offers a more simplified, scalable, and cost-effective approach to deploying and running applications compared to traditional server-based architectures. It promotes faster development cycles, improved resource utilization, and increased flexibility in responding to changing workloads.

## start serverless functions with Vercel
1- Sign up and Install Vercel: Visit the Vercel website (vercel.com) and sign up for an account. Once registered, install the Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) on your local machine using the provided instructions.

2- Create a Project: In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory and use the Vercel CLI to initialize a new project. Run the command vercel init and follow the prompts to set up your project.

3- Write your Serverless Function: Create a new file for your serverless function, such as api/myfunction.js. Write your serverless function code in this file. Remember, serverless functions are typically stateless and respond to specific events or requests.

4- Test Locally: Use the Vercel CLI to test your serverless function locally before deployment. Run the command vercel dev to start the local development server and test your function using the provided local URL.

5- Configure Deployment Settings: Create a configuration file, such as vercel.json, to specify deployment settings for your project. This file allows you to customize build settings, environment variables, routing, and more.

6- Deploy to Vercel: Once you are ready to deploy your serverless function, run the command vercel in your project directory. The Vercel CLI will guide you through the deployment process, including providing options for custom domains, environment variables, and other deployment settings.

7- Monitor and Manage Deployments: After the deployment is complete, Vercel provides you with a unique URL where your serverless function is hosted. You can monitor your deployments, manage settings, and make updates through the Vercel dashboard or using the CLI.

## APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs enable developers to access and manipulate data from external sources such as web services, databases, or other applications.

In Python, APIs can be utilized to access and manipulate data from external sources by following these general steps:

1- API Documentation: Start by reading the documentation provided by the API provider. It typically includes information on endpoints, authentication methods, request formats, and response formats.

2- Install Required Libraries: Depending on the API, you may need to install specific Python libraries to facilitate the interaction. Commonly used libraries include requests, urllib, or higher-level libraries like python-requests or http.client.

3- Make API Requests: Use the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to make requests to the API endpoints. This involves constructing the request URL, including any required parameters or headers.

4- Handle Authentication: If the API requires authentication, you'll need to include the necessary credentials or authentication tokens in your requests. This may involve setting headers or providing authentication parameters.

5- Process API Responses: After sending a request, you'll receive a response from the API. Typically, responses are in formats like JSON or XML. Use Python libraries to parse and extract the desired data from the response.

6- Handle Errors and Exceptions: APIs may return error responses or encounter issues during requests. Implement error handling mechanisms in your code to gracefully handle and recover from errors or exceptions.

7- Manipulate and Use Retrieved Data: Once you have retrieved the data from the API, you can manipulate and use it as needed in your Python application. This could involve storing it in a database, performing data analysis, or integrating it into your application's functionality.

## Requests library in Python

The Requests library is a popular Python library used for sending HTTP requests and interacting with APIs. It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests by providing a user-friendly interface and handling underlying complexities such as connection management, request construction, and response parsing.

To use the Requests library, you first need to install it. You can install it using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

```
pip install requests
```
Once installed, you can import the library in your Python script and start making requests.

Here's an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:

```python
import requests

# Send a GET request to the specified URL
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users')

# Check the response status code
if response.status_code == 200:
    # The request was successful
    data = response.json()  # Parse the response JSON data
    print(data)  # Print the retrieved data
else:
    # The request was not successful
    print('Error:', response.status_code)
    ```
In the above example, the get() function from the Requests library is used to send a GET request to the specified URL (https://api.example.com/users). The response is stored in the response variable.

The status code of the response is then checked using response.status_code. In this case, if the status code is 200 (indicating a successful request), the response data is parsed as JSON using response.json(). Finally, the retrieved data is printed.

The Requests library provides various other functions and features to handle different types of requests, handle request parameters, headers, cookies, and more. You can refer to the Requests library documentation (https://docs.python-requests.org/) for more details and explore the extensive capabilities it offers for interacting with APIs.
