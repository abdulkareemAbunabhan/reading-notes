# Stacks and queues
Stacks and Queues are abstract data structures that have similar functionalities, but different behaviors in terms of how they operate. Stacks are based on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. On the other hand, Queues are based on the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Both Stacks and Queues are commonly used in computer science and programming. They provide a way to store and retrieve data efficiently and with a predictable behavior. In terms of implementation, both data structures can be created using arrays or linked lists. In this context, linked lists are more commonly used because they allow for dynamic memory allocation, which is useful when the size of the data structure is not known in advance.

In a linked list implementation of a Stack, each element in the stack is represented as a Node object that contains a value and a reference to the next Node in the stack. The top of the stack is represented as a reference to the Node object that was added last. Adding an element to the stack is called "pushing", while removing an element from the stack is called "popping". When an element is pushed onto the stack, it becomes the new top of the stack. When an element is popped from the stack, the top of the stack is removed, and the reference to the top is updated to the next Node in the stack. In this way, the Stack follows the LIFO principle.

In a linked list implementation of a Queue, each element in the queue is represented as a Node object that contains a value and a reference to the next Node in the queue. The front of the queue is represented as a reference to the Node object that was added first, while the rear of the queue is represented as a reference to the Node object that was added last. Adding an element to the queue is called "enqueueing", while removing an element from the queue is called "dequeueing". When an element is enqueued, it becomes the new rear of the queue. When an element is dequeued, the front of the queue is removed, and the reference to the front is updated to the next Node in the queue. In this way, the Queue follows the FIFO principle.

### In conclusion
both Stacks and Queues are fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming. They provide efficient ways to store and retrieve data, and their predictable behavior makes them useful for a variety of applications. By understanding the principles and implementations of Stacks and Queues, you can become a more proficient programmer and develop more efficient algorithms.
