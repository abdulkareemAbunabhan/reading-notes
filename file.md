# Why me?
The one thing I bring to my career and potential employer that nobody else can is my unique combination of analytical and execution skills. My ability to identify and solve problems at their root cause, along with my proficiency in executing projects, sets me apart from others who may excel in one area but not the other. I can leverage this combination of skills to drive results and add value to any team or organization I work with.

# Three things to un-stick my self when ever i get stuck 
1-Break the problem down: Complex problems can be overwhelming, so try breaking them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This approach can help you identify the root cause of the problem and tackle it step-by-step, instead of getting lost in the details.
2-Take a break: Sometimes, taking a break from the problem can help you clear your mind and approach it with a fresh perspective. Go for a walk, do some exercise, or engage in a different activity to help you relax and refocus.
3-Seek help: Don't be afraid to ask for help when you're stuck. Reach out to colleagues, mentors, or online communities for advice and guidance. Collaborating with others can help you see the problem from different angles and find new solutions.
