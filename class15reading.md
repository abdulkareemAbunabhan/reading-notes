# Trees 
## Why:

Trees are a fundamental data structure used to represent hierarchical relationships between elements.
They are useful for organizing and manipulating data efficiently, especially in scenarios where data has a hierarchical nature.

## What:

Trees consist of nodes connected by edges. Each node can have zero or more child nodes.
The topmost node is called the root, and nodes without children are called leaf nodes.
Nodes in a tree can have a parent-child relationship, where the parent is connected to its child nodes.
Trees can have different structures, such as binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees.

## How:

Trees can be implemented using various techniques, including linked structures and array-based representations.
Traversing a tree involves visiting each node in a specific order. Common traversal methods include pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal.
Tree operations include inserting nodes, deleting nodes, searching for a specific node, and balancing the tree.
Trees can be used in various applications, such as organizing file systems, representing hierarchical relationships in databases, and implementing decision-making algorithms.

Trees provide a powerful and flexible way to organize hierarchical data and perform efficient operations on them. They are a fundamental concept in computer science and are widely used to 
solve complex problems efficiently.
