# Tutorial: Introduction to Graphs
## What is a Graph?
In computer science, a graph is a non-linear data structure composed of nodes (also known as vertices) connected by edges. It is a powerful tool used to represent and analyze relationships between objects or entities.

## Why are Graphs Useful?
Graphs have numerous applications in various domains, including social networks, transportation systems, computer networks, recommendation systems, and more. They provide a visual representation of complex relationships and enable efficient algorithms for traversing and analyzing connected data.

## Key Components of a Graph:
* Nodes (Vertices): Represent individual entities or objects. For example, in a social network graph, each person would be a node.

* Edges: Represent connections between nodes. They establish relationships and interactions between entities. For instance, in a social network graph, edges could indicate friendships or connections between individuals.
